# NotSoBasicArduino

## NewPing()
### Description
In these assignments I made it so that if the sensor was below a certain distance from a surface,
 the servo would rotate one direction, and if it was above that number then the servo would
 rotate in the opposite direction.

 ### What I learned
 Other people have coded the same things as I might want, and if I need that code it can be much faster to look up what I want and see if somebody before me has already done the work.

 The hardest part was definitely figuring out how to code a new device to me such as the
 Ultrasonic Sensor. There were other parts of the code, too, that were hard, like the if statements, but none of the wiring ever 
 seemed to be that hard. I've never really had problems with the wiring, even though I constantly struggle with coding all the 
 time.
